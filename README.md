# WebDev2
For Web Platform Development 2

We made the application using Node.JS
Due to time constraints there are limits to the functionality of the code.

To beginn you'll have to ensure that you have Node installed. To do this go to this link https://nodejs.org/en/ 

After installing Node you'll need to enter the following commands

node -v    this will show you the version of node you have, this ensures that node is installed correctly

npm -v     this ensures that npm has also been installed with the node installation 

Ensure that you are in the repository directory in the command line. The following commands will ensure that the server can be now run:

npm install

node server.js 

the command line should have displayed that the app is now listening on port 8000.

The nest step is to open a web browser and enter localhost:8000
